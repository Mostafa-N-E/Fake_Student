Your computer participates in the virtual class instead of you and even does relative activity in the classroom

### About project
For most of us students like myselfroll_eyes:, the virtual class is summarized in the activity inside chat box with these comments "سلام استاد" ,"+" ,"-" and "خسته نباشید" :joy:

Now, if it is a general lesson or a lesson in general that going to class is just a useless task, we will do the same activity by force.
of course, if you have a class at 8 in the morning, it doesn't matter what the lesson is anymore, it is pure suffering  :joy: :joy:

But we can do all these limited but vital activities automatically
From now on, sleep well and pray for your brother :smile:
